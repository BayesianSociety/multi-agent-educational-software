Updated `TEST.md` with a strict minimal edit to align docs with the brief:

- Kept the verified deterministic offline command: `npm --prefix frontend run test`
- Added a Docker Compose SQLite variant:
  - `docker compose up -d sqlite`
  - `npm --prefix frontend run test`
  - `docker compose stop sqlite`

Validation status:
- Confirmed `npm --prefix frontend run test` passes with exit code `0`.
- Could not run Docker Compose in this environment because `docker` is not installed/available in the current WSL distro.

Only file changed:
- `TEST.md`
