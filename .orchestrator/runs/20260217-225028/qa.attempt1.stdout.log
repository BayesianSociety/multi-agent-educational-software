QA step completed with no code changes.

Executed deterministic test command from `TEST.md` twice:

- `npm --prefix frontend run test`
- Result both runs: `pass 3`, `fail 0`, exit code `0`
- Passing files: `tests/backend.levels.test.ts`, `tests/backend.server.test.ts`, `tests/engine.test.ts`

No edits were necessary under `tests/**` or `TEST.md`.
