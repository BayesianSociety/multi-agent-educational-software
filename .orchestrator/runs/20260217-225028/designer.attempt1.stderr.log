- Do not modify .git/**
- Do not modify files outside the allowlist
- Do not contradict PROJECT_BRIEF.md

Project brief (Layer 0-2 reference, do not contradict):
# Layer 0 - Non-negotiables
- **Target platform:** Web (modern browsers)
- **Audience / age range:** 7-12
- **Safety & privacy stance:** No accounts, no PII collection, no external network calls required to play levels. Local-only persistence (e.g., localStorage).
- **Accessibility baseline:** Keyboard operable for core interactions; visible focus states; readable font sizing; avoid color-only meaning; narration text available as on-screen text.

# Layer 1 - MVP + Core learning loop
## Core learning objectives
- **Sequencing:** blocks run top-to-bottom / left-to-right in a deterministic order
- **Procedural thinking:** plan steps to reach a goal
- **Debugging:** observe step-by-step execution and adjust blocks

## Core experience / gameplay loop
- Player assembles a small program from blocks (at MVP: **Move**, **Jump**) to guide a dog to a bone.
- Player presses **Run**.
- The dog animates while the UI highlights the current block.
- If the dog fails (falls into a gap, hits obstacle, doesn't reach bone), player edits blocks and tries again.

## MVP scope
- 10 short levels.
- Blocks:
  - **Move(1)**: move dog forward by 1 tile
  - **Jump**: leap over a single-tile gap/obstacle
  - **Run/Start**: executes block sequence
- Minimal tutorial: Level 1 teaches Move; Level 2 teaches Jump.
- Narrative: one sentence per level + small "story progression" between worlds (e.g., "Taffy is exploring the park to find treats!").

## Non-goals
- Multiplayer
- User accounts / cloud saves
- Complex physics simulation
- Advanced Scratch features (variables, custom blocks) in MVP

## Acceptance criteria (MVP)
- Level runner executes blocks deterministically and highlights current block during execution.
- Level 1 can be solved with a small block sequence (Move/Jump/Move...) to reach the bone.
- The app stores unlocked levels locally and restores progress on refresh.
- Tests run deterministically and exit with code 0.

# Layer 2 - Architecture constraints
- **Backend REQUIRED** for MVP. The `/backend` directory MUST contain server logic.
- **Frontend framework:** Next.js (TypeScript). The Next.js app MUST live in `/frontend`.
- **Backend framework:** Node.js API (TypeScript) living in `/backend` (e.g., Express/Fastify) OR Next.js route handlers in `/frontend` (choose ONE and follow it consistently).
- **Database:** SQLite is the source of truth. Local development MUST use Docker Compose (repo-root `docker-compose.yml`).
- **Data access / migrations:** Use Prisma (or explicitly choose another migration tool). If Prisma: include `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and migrations workflow.
- **Level format:** JSON files under `/design/levels/` (one file per level) OR stored in SQLite (choose ONE; for MVP prefer JSON-on-disk unless you truly need DB-authored content).
- **Execution model:** Compile blocks into a simple internal instruction list, then interpret step-by-step deterministically.
- **Persistence:** Store user progress in SQLite ONLY if you have accounts. If no accounts, store progress locally (localStorage) and keep DB for content/admin only.
- **Testing:** must run offline and deterministically. Provide a deterministic test command in `TEST.md` and ensure it exits with code 0. Tests MUST spin up SQLite locally (docker compose) or use a deterministic test DB container.
- **Security:** No secrets committed. Provide `.env.example` and keep real secrets out of the repo.

# Layer 3 - Content & UX specifics (may evolve iteratively under /design/**)
## Scratch-like editor UX
- Palette of blocks on the left, workspace in the middle, play area on the right.
- Blocks snap/connect vertically in a single sequence for MVP.
- "Run" button starts execution; "Reset" returns dog to start position.

## Level 1 (reference example: dog must reach bone)
- Narrative bubble: **"Taffy really wants that bone!"**
- Start: dog on left side of the room.
- Goal: bone on right side of the room.
- At least one obstacle in early levels:
  - Level 1: no gap; solvable with several Move blocks
  - Level 2+: introduce a gap requiring Jump

## Visual tone
- Friendly, bright, kid-safe visuals.
- Simple animations: dog walks, jumps; bone sparkles on success.

**Planning initial inspection**

I’ll handle this as the `designer` step with strict minimal edits, limited to `design/**` and `REQUIREMENTS.md`. First I’m checking the current UX/design docs to make a focused update that stays aligned with `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

# Requirements (MVP)

## Product goals
- Build a web-based coding game for ages 7-12 where players guide a dog to a bone using simple blocks.
- Teach sequencing, procedural thinking, and debugging through deterministic step-by-step execution.

## Functional requirements
- FR-1: The app shall run in modern web browsers.
- FR-2: The editor shall provide blocks `Move(1)` and `Jump` in MVP.
- FR-3: The workspace shall support a single vertical sequence of blocks.
- FR-4: Pressing `Run` shall compile the block list into internal instructions and execute deterministically from first to last.
- FR-5: During execution, the currently running block shall be visibly highlighted.
- FR-6: Pressing `Reset` shall return the dog to the level start state.
- FR-7: The game shall include exactly 10 short MVP levels.
- FR-8: Level 1 shall teach `Move` and be solvable without `Jump`.
- FR-9: Level 2 shall introduce a single-tile gap/obstacle requiring `Jump`.
- FR-10: Each level shall show one sentence of narrative text; Level 1 narrative is "Taffy really wants that bone!".
- FR-11: Failure states (gap/obstacle/missed goal) shall allow immediate edit-and-retry.
- FR-12: Unlocked level progress shall persist locally in `localStorage` and restore on refresh.

**Assessing designer output location**
codex
I confirmed requirements are already set; for this designer step I’ll add only UX/design artifacts under `design/**` (no code scaffolding) so the next implementation steps have concrete, testable layout and content guidance.

**Defining minimal level designs**
codex
I have enough context and will now make minimal designer deliverables: create `design/levels/` with 10 deterministic level JSON specs (including Level 1 and 2 tutorial constraints) plus one concise UX spec in `design/` to guide layout, accessibility, and feedback states.
exec
/bin/bash -lc "mkdir -p design/levels && cat > design/UX_SPEC.md << 'EOF'
# UX Spec (MVP)

## Screen layout
- Left: block palette ("'`Move(1)`, `Jump`)
- Middle: vertical workspace sequence (single lane)
- Right: playfield with dog, tiles, hazards, and bone goal
- Top controls: `Run`, `Reset`, level selector, level narrative text

## Interaction model
- Drag or click to add blocks from palette into workspace.
- Workspace executes top-to-bottom in deterministic order.
- `Run` compiles workspace into instruction list and executes step-by-step.
- Active block is highlighted during execution.
- `Reset` returns dog to start tile and clears runtime state.
- On failure, show clear on-screen text and keep blocks editable for immediate retry.

## Accessibility baseline
- Full keyboard path for block selection, ordering, `Run`, and `Reset`.
- Visible focus ring for all interactive controls.
- Success/failure and active-step states use icon/text, not color alone.
- Narrative text is always visible on screen.
- Base text size target: 16px minimum for UI controls and key labels.

## Visual tone
- Friendly, bright, kid-safe style.
- Dog movement states: idle, walk, jump.
- Goal feedback: bone sparkle animation on success.

**Noting existing dirty files and clarifying skills**
codex
Implemented the `designer` step with strict minimal edits, only under `design/**` (no changes to `.orchestrator/**`, `.git/**`, or other paths).

### Added
- `design/UX_SPEC.md`
- `design/levels/level-01.json`
- `design/levels/level-02.json`
- `design/levels/level-03.json`
- `design/levels/level-04.json`
- `design/levels/level-05.json`
- `design/levels/level-06.json`
- `design/levels/level-07.json`
- `design/levels/level-08.json`
- `design/levels/level-09.json`
- `design/levels/level-10.json`

### What this covers
- UX layout and interaction guidance for palette/workspace/playfield, `Run`/`Reset`, block highlighting, and failure feedback in `design/UX_SPEC.md`.
- 10 deterministic MVP level definitions in `design/levels/` with:
  - Level 1 teaching `Move` and no gap.
  - Level 2 introducing `Jump` with a single-tile gap.
  - One narrative sentence per level and simple world progression.
  - Only `Move` and `Jump` blocks.

### Validation
- Parsed all `design/levels/*.json` successfully with Node (`JSON.parse`) to confirm valid JSON.
