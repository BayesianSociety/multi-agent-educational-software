Implemented the `requirements` step with minimal edits to the allowlisted files only:

- Created `REQUIREMENTS.md` with concise MVP requirements:
  - Functional requirements (`Move`, `Jump`, `Run/Reset`, 10 levels, deterministic execution, block highlighting, retry loop, localStorage progress)
  - Architecture/data constraints (`/frontend` Next.js TS, `/backend` Node TS, SQLite, Prisma, `docker-compose.yml`, level JSON under `/design/levels/`)
  - Privacy/accessibility/testing non-functionals
  - Explicit MVP non-goals
- Created `AGENT_TASKS.md` with:
  - Completed checklist for this requirements step
  - Minimal handoff checklist for downstream implementation steps

Files:
- `REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `AGENT_TASKS.md`
