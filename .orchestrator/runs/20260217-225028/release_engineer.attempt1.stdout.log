Implemented strict minimal release-engineer edits within the allowlist:

1. Added environment template in `.env.example`
2. Added baseline ignores in `.gitignore`
3. Added deterministic test instructions in `TEST.md`
4. Added local Docker Compose baseline in `docker-compose.yml` (SQLite utility container + backend/frontend placeholders)

Validation run:
1. Executed the command documented in `TEST.md`
2. Result: exit code `0` with output `No tests committed yet (deterministic no-op).`

Changed files:
- `.env.example`
- `.gitignore`
- `TEST.md`
- `docker-compose.yml`
